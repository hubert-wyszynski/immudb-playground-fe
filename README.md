# Immudb Playground Frontend

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.x)
- Docker

## Running the application
1. Run `docker compose up` to start the frontend container.
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Note:
- The backend server must be run first for the frontend to work as it setup Immudb Vault initially. I didn't have time to handle the Vault setup on the frontend.
